            <p>The arrest of a City Honors teacher this week happened because four middle-school students stepped forward to report what they thought was creepy classroom behavior, but which turned out to be far worse than even they realized, authorities said.</p>
            <p>That took guts on their part.</p>
            <p>“All the credit to them. I’m sure it wasn’t easy," said U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy Jr.</p>
            <p>It also may be a sign that, in an age of priest scandals and the Child Victims Act, the message to report abuse or exploitation against children is being heard, along with the reassurance that their allegations will be taken seriously.</p>
            <p>“The message to our students and to young people everywhere is, if you say something, we will do something,” Kennedy said.</p>
            
            <p>Following an FBI investigation, Peter Hingston, a middle-school technology teacher at City Honors for 10 years, was charged Thursday with attempted sexual exploitation of a child, sexual exploitation of a child and possession of material that contained an image of child pornography.</p>
            <p>Hingston, 59, of Amherst, is accused of using a GoPro camera to covertly take pictures or recordings of unsuspecting female students. In one case, a student reported the teacher taking a picture of a girl's breasts. When authorities looked at his videos, what they say he was doing turned out to be far more disturbing.</p>
            <p>The criminal complaint against him describes numerous recordings taken from Hingston's camera that show him rubbing his unclothed genitals against girls, often along the back of their hair. He did it surreptitiously in class, according to court papers, when the girls were working on a laptop, for example, and weren’t paying attention to what he was doing.</p>
            <p>Authorities cited 24 videos in which Hingston uses or tries to use students in his sexually explicit conduct.</p>
            <p>“I think we’re starting to realize as a country how widespread some of this sort of behavior has been and how much suffering and harm it has caused to children,” Kennedy said Friday. “We’re trying to be sensitive to it and responsive to it so others aren’t victimized.”</p>

                <hr width="650">
            <p>As for what the four students did, Kennedy hopes it’s a sign the tide is turning and more people are feeling empowered to report these type of cases against the backdrop of the Child Victims Act, the sexual abuse scandal involving Catholic priests, and the Me Too Movement.</p>
